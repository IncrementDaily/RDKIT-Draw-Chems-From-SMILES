### Vague Instructions

(1) Install the rdkit cheminformatics library by following this link https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html. It is easiest to use the conda environment instructions in my opinion.

(2) Populate a .csv file with SMILES strings, chemical names (IUPAC), and CAS numbers.

(3) Run the scripts using your .csv to generate images of those chemicals for useage in UI or elsewhere.

### Where To Get Data

NIST chemistry webbook is very easy to parse using jQuery or some other framework for interacting with the HTML DOM. You can get SMILES strings, CAS numbers, and IUPAC chemical names from this website.
